# Multi_thread_professor_assistant_exam
A small project demonstrating threading in java.

This project is simulating students having a exam which can be held at the professor(only two students at the same time),
or at the assistant(one student at time). The number of students can be changed in the code and there are 5s where students
can do their exam. They do the exam concurently (2 at professor and 1 at asssitang). Some students will not get to finish 
their exam (they waited to long for another student at the professors table or didnt finish after starting).
